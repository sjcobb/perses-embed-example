### How it works

üê¢üöÄ This is a Node.js app! It's powered by:

- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud.
- [Stable Diffusion](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion), an open-source text-to-image generation model.
- Next.js [server-side API routes](pages/api) for talking to the Replicate API
- Next.js React components for the inpainting GUI
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for Icons

### Development

Prerequisites:

1. Recent version of Node.js
2. [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account)

Set your Replicate API token in your environment:

```
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```

Then install dependencies and run the server:

```
